ABSTRACT
========

Java Unix Domain Sockets (JUDS) provide classes to address the need in Java
for accessing Unix domain sockets. The source is provided for a shared library
containing the compiled native C code, which is called into by the Java
UnixDomainSocket classes via JNI (Java Native Interface) to open, close, unlink
(delete), read, and write to Unix domain sockets.


DESCRIPTION
===========

JUDS is similar with and inspired by J-BUDS. However, JUDS has been written to
have more performance than J-BUDS while supplying all features Unix domain
sockets have.
JUDS consists of an abstract class UnixDomainSocket and two derived classes,
UnixDomainSocketClient and UnixDomainSocketServer. It can simply be used by
instantiating one of the two classes. Through the getInputStream and
getOutputStream methods, the resulting instance can be used to get an
InputStream and/or OutputStream object.

Limitations:

Datagram sockets are unidirectional, i.e. trying to get an OutputStream for an
UnixDomainSocketServer object results in an UnsupportedOperationException being
thrown. Accordingly trying to get an InputStream for an UnixDomainSocketClient
also results in such an exception being thrown.
Stream sockets can only handle connections between two end points. Trying to
connect to an UnixDomainSocketServer which has already accepted a connection
with another client will result in an error.


VERSION
=======

Version 0.7 - 2008-07-17


VERSION HISTORY
===============

Version 0.7 - 2008-07-16
    - Made changes to the makefile. This fixes some issues for building under
      non-Linux platforms.
    - Added a note how to fix an issue under cygwin to the documentation.
    - Restructured the documentation.

Version 0.6 - 2008-06-03
    - Made some minor refactoring and orthographical corrections.
      No difference in functional to version 0.5.

Version 0.5 - 2008-03-05
    - Initial version


INSTALLATION
============

The java UnixDomainSocket classes use native methods in order to access AF_UNIX
sockets for interprocess communication. JUDS can be installed by using the
included makefile.
IMPORTANT NOTE:  In order for the compilation process to work, it is likely
that you need to change one or more of the top four variables in the makefile.

A installation process could look like this:

	make
	make install

make install does nothing more than copying the shared library
libunixdomainsocket.so to the /usr/lib directory. Alternatively you can also
set the variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that includes the directory where
libunixdomainsocket.so is included.


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

There might be issues with gcc under cygwin because the type __int64 used in
jni.h is not defined. Here are some proposals how that can be fixed:

(see also the comments)

Please send bug reports and comments to klaus.trainer@web.de.


TESTING
=======

To test the installation, the file TestUnixDomainSocket.java has to be
compiled. This can be done by simply entering:

	make test

Now a test can be performed through first executing the included python program
Test_UnixDomainSocket.py with a socket filename as command line argument.
For example, this could look like this:

	python Test_UnixDomainSocket.py socketfile

Accordingly, the Java class file TestUnixDomainSocket.class has to be executed
with the same socket filename as above for command line argument, e.g.:

	java TestUnixDomainSocket socketfile

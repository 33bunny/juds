ABSTRACT
========

Java Unix Domain Sockets (JUDS) provide classes to address the need in Java
for accessing Unix domain sockets. The source is provided for a shared library
containing the compiled native C code, which is called into by the Java
UnixDomainSocket classes via JNI (Java Native Interface) to open, close, unlink
(delete), read, and write to Unix domain sockets.


DESCRIPTION
===========

JUDS is similar with and inspired by J-BUDS. However, JUDS has been written to
have more performance than J-BUDS while supplying all features Unix domain
sockets have.
JUDS consists of an abstract class UnixDomainSocket and two derived classes,
UnixDomainSocketClient and UnixDomainSocketServer. It can simply be used by
instantiating one of the two classes. Through the getInputStream and
getOutputStream methods, the resulting instance can be used to get an
InputStream and/or OutputStream object.

Limitations:

Datagram sockets are unidirectional, i.e. trying to get an OutputStream for an
UnixDomainSocketServer object results in an UnsupportedOperationException being
thrown. Accordingly trying to get an InputStream for an UnixDomainSocketClient
also results in such an exception being thrown.
Stream sockets can only handle connections between two end points. Trying to
connect to an UnixDomainSocketServer which has already accepted a connection
with another client will result in an error.


VERSION
=======

Version 0.8 - 2008-12-06


VERSION HISTORY
===============

Version 0.8 - 2008-12-06
    - Fixed UnixDomainSocket.UnixDomainSocketInputStream.read() method in order
      to return correct results (Thanks to Roman Kosenko!).
    - Rearranged test, made it more comprehensible. Now the test can be
      launched by running the make target 'test'. There isn't any additional
      operation from the user required anymore (Thanks to Roman Kosenko!).
    - Introduced package structure (com.google.code.juds), improved Makefile.
    - Added unlink(socketFile) calls in UnixDomainSocket.c for the case of
      failing listen() or accept() calls to remove the unused socket file
      (Thanks Alan Harder!).

Version 0.7 - 2008-07-16
    - Made changes to the makefile. This fixes some issues for building under
      non-Linux platforms.
    - Added a note how to fix an issue under cygwin to the documentation.
    - Restructured the documentation.

Version 0.6 - 2008-06-03
    - Made some minor refactoring and orthographical corrections.
      No difference in functionality to version 0.5.

Version 0.5 - 2008-03-05
    - Initial version


INSTALLATION
============

The java UnixDomainSocket classes use native methods in order to access AF_UNIX
sockets for interprocess communication. JUDS can be installed by using the
included makefile.
IMPORTANT NOTE:  In order for the compilation process to work, it is likely
that you need to change one or more of the top four variables in the makefile.

A installation process could look like this:

	make
	make install

make install does nothing more than copying the shared library
libunixdomainsocket.so to the /usr/lib directory. Alternatively you can also
set the variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that includes the directory where
libunixdomainsocket.so is included.


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

There might be issues with gcc under cygwin because the type __int64 used in
jni.h is not defined. Here are some proposals how that can be fixed:

Please send bug reports and comments to klaus.trainer@web.de.


TESTING
=======

To test the installation, simply run the make target 'test':
	make test
